However, the Stand is still made up of physical matter, and thus is similar to an Enhancement type Stand in that they can be damaged physically by Non-Stand damage types."

  note: "When attacking using a Swarm of Stands, there is a way to attack with all of them without rolling dozens of attacks. Firstly, if more than half of the Instances are attacking at once you can treat it like a regular Stand Attack, using 1d6 + Power/N where N is the number of Instances attacking. If less than half of your instances are attacking, assume a certain percentage of them land a Stand Hit (unless the target does not have a Stand, in which case it is direct), but they may only deal 1 damage per hit. At Level 1 this percentage is 5%, meaning Swarm damage is equal to N/20 with a minimum of 1 damage, where N is the number of Instances attacking. At Level 11 this increases to 10%, or N/10, with a minimum of 1 damage. You may not add Power to this damage. Note: Keep an eye on your health. The amount of Instances available for you to use is determined by the percentage of health you are at. If you are at 50% Health, you only have 50% of your Hive Stand available for use. When you are at 0 Hit Points, you may still have a maximum of 1 Stand Instance that functions, but it is recalled, and cannot act in any way. Your amount of Stand Instances only drops to 0 when you die."
