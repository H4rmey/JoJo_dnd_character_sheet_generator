  - name: "Anchored Stand"
    text: "Your Stand is physically attached, and anchored to a physical object. Your Stand, as such, may be damaged by physical means, as well as with Stands. However, regardless of if your Stand takes Physical or Stand Damage, you still apply the same damage reduction to it. Also, both you and your Stand gain Vulnerability to one Damage Type of your choice (as well as the Stand counterpart to that damage). If you are an Enhancement Type Stand User, you must find an amount of Material (or a specific object) that fits your specific anchor. This Material must be within your Standʼs Range Modifier in order for you to use it, and Activate your Stand."

  - name: "Custom Ability"
    text: "This is something that must be discussed with the DM of your Campaign. Further Details can be found in the Stands section, further above in the document. Stand Abilities are something integral to the existence of Stands, and itʼs a huge part of what makes JoJoʼs Bizarre Adventure such a fun, varied, and unique experience. A general rule of thumb is that the more specific your Stand Ability is, the more powerful it is. However, the more general it is, the more versatile it can be. Examples of Abilities are Anubisʼs possession, Hermit Purpleʼs Spirit photos, or White Albumʼs ability to freeze. A Custom Ability might also be a passive ability that may be activated or deactivated at will. Passive Abilities consume 1 Stand Energy at the Start of the Stand Userʼs Turn, and also take their Bonus Action to perform. If you are unable to use your Bonus Action, or you do not have enough Stand Energy remaining, the ability simply stops functioning."

Rather than having to anchor onto something specific (Metal Bar, Car, Boat), you may now anchor onto something similar to your original anchor (Example: heel of Fortune could anchor onto anything with wheels, Strength would be anything that floats in water)."

At some point within this timeframe, your Stand reawakens, as an Independent Type Stand, complete with your Mental Capacity and Memories. You retain all of your Experience Points, but all of your Health, Feats, Proficiencies and Abilities are reset. This effectively means you may make a higher level character, so long as it retains the same Memories you had in your First Life."

  - name: "Self-Repair"
    text: "You, or your Stand, acts independently of everything else. It does not have a physical form outside of the form that it/you has/have taken. As such, it/you must find a way to protect itself/yourself and survive. As an Action, you may spend a Hit Die to heal, but you must spend 2 Hit Dice in order to get the result of one Hit Dice. If you do not have enough Hit Dice for that roll, you may not heal. Outside of Combat, every Minute that you stand perfectly still, you may heal an amount of Health equal to your Durability Modifier."

  - name: "Special Abilities"
    text: "These are powers that use the same concept of the regular Custom Ability, but taken to a whole new level. These abilities have immense strength, at twice the cost of a normal Ability (Usually twice the Stand Energy). When used, these abilities take a lot more Stand Energy than a regular ability. Special Abilities is usually 1 Bracket of Dice Stronger than the ability would be normally (d8 would become d10, d4 would become d6). They also take more time to perform, usually, but not always, taking a Full Action to perform. Examples of Special Abilities are The Worldʼs The World, King Crimsonʼs Time Deletion, or Weather Reportʼs Heavy Weather. A Special Ability might also be a passive ability that functions independently of activation. A Special Ability might also be a passive ability that may be activated or deactivated at will. Passive Abilities consume 2 Stand Energy at the Start of the Stand Userʼs Turn, and also take their Bonus Action to perform. If you are unable to use your Bonus Action, or you do not have enough Stand Energy remaining, the ability simply stops functioning."

At any time, as a Reaction, you may call your Stand back to you, allowing it to come back and defend you, or perform any action requiring your Stand to be near you, up to its Movement Speed. This also means that your AC may be increased to your Standʼs AC if it is able to return to you. However, when your Stand returns to you, if it passes through the Melee Range of a Stand or Creature that can sense it, the Stand/Creature may make an Attack of Opportunity against your Stand."

    text: "Is a Hive Type Stand User, your Stand functions very differently than a typical Stand. Rather than a Stand being an extension of your Will To Fight, Each Instance of your Stand is like a separate organism, that simply must follow your orders. Each Instance of your Stand only has a fraction of the Power of a regular Stand. Not only that, but each Instance may act independently of the others or the Stand User. Not only that, but if one Instance is totally destroyed, that fraction of the Userʼs Health is taken away (If you have 12 Instances of your Stand, and one gets destroyed, take your total Health, then divide it by 12, and that is how much damage you take). If every Instance of your Stand is destroyed, you die instantly. If your health is restored, so are your Stand Instances. Even when you fall unconscious, you still have 1 Stand Instance. Only when you die is that Instance erased."

In Ranged Mode, Remote Stands may function as any other Stand does, in that they may be controlled by the userʼs will, and can follow specific commands. However, while in Ranged Mode, you may not use your Stand Ability, nor your Special Stand Ability. If your Stand has Stand Marking active, that also shuts off upon changing to Ranged Mode. Your Stand has the same stats regardless of the mode that they are in."
