    description: 'Many Stands are able to physically manifest themselves clearly and powerfully, but most Ability-Type Stands do not function in the same way. Some Ability Stands are not visible or tangible unless specifically made so by their user. While these Stands have very little in the way of physical power, their masterful use of their Abilities are able to make them more than handy in the fight. '
